h1. Problem Set Write-Ups by Victor Costan

This site contains write-ups for the problem sets that I (Victor Costan) was
assigned in my MIT classes.

h2. Installation

The repository is one big Eclipse project, using the Texlipse plugin that you
can download at http://texlipse.sourceforge.net/

The write-ups are built using some derivative of the Tex Live distribution that
can be found at http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html. More specifically, the
following derivatives are used:
* MacTex, on MacOS X Snow Leopard: http://www.tug.org/mactex/downloading.html
* the following packages on Ubuntu 9.10: TBD 

h2. Academic Honesty

If you're a student in one of my classes, I expect that you won't look at my
solutions before the deadlines for the problem sets. If you use my work for
other problem sets, I expect that you will acknowledge this source.
